**Event:** DevLaunch Hackathon 2026 (WPBrigade × iCodeGuru)

CropGuard is a multi-modal AI-powered system designed to assist traditional farmers by detecting crop diseases from leaf images and providing **spoken Urdu guidance**. The platform leverages state-of-the-art **computer vision, natural language processing, and speech synthesis** to make advanced agricultural intelligence accessible to non-technical users.

The system allows farmers to simply upload a crop image. The AI then identifies the crop and disease, explains the issue in English, translates the result into Urdu, and finally converts it into **natural Urdu voice output**, enabling farmers to interact with the system without needing literacy or technical skills.

## 🎯 Project Overview

CropGuard addresses a real-world problem in agriculture:  
**farmers lack instant access to expert-level crop disease diagnosis.**

By using modern AI models, CropGuard provides:

- Crop name detection  
- Disease identification  
- Confidence score  
- Disease description  
- Recommended pesticide  
- **Urdu text guidance**  
- **Urdu voice assistance (hands-free)**  

This project demonstrates an end-to-end **multi-modal AI system** combining:

- Vision AI  
- NLP translation  
- Speech synthesis  

Built as a **hackathon demo**, but architected to be **scalable and production-ready**.

## 🧠 AI Model & Intelligence Pipeline

### Gemini Flash 3 (Vision AI)

Gemini Flash 3 is a lightweight and high-performance multimodal model capable of understanding images and generating structured textual outputs.

In CropGuard, Gemini Flash 3 is used to:

- Analyze crop leaf images  
- Identify crop type  
- Detect disease patterns  
- Generate human-readable diagnosis  

### Language & Voice Intelligence

After vision inference:

1. Output is generated in **English**  
2. Gemini Translation API converts English → **Urdu**  
3. Google Voice API converts Urdu text → **natural Urdu speech**

This enables:

- Voice-based interaction  
- Accessibility for illiterate farmers  
- Real-world usability in rural Pakistan  

---

## 📊 Supported Crops

CropGuard is designed to work with **multiple crop types**, including but not limited to:

- Wheat  
- Rice  
- Cotton  
- Tomato  
- Potato  
- Sugarcane  
- Maize  
- Vegetables and fruits  

The system is **model-agnostic** and can scale to more crops without retraining.

---

## 🔬 Testing & Evaluation

Since this project is based on **real-time AI inference (no custom training)**, evaluation was performed through:

- Manual testing on multiple crop images  
- Cross-verification with online agricultural sources  
- Live testing during hackathon demo  

The system demonstrated:

- High confidence predictions for common crops  
- Accurate disease identification for visible symptoms  
- Consistent translation and voice generation  

This validates CropGuard as a **practical real-world AI assistant**, not just a theoretical model.

---

## 🚀 Deployment Architecture

### Current Status

- **Hackathon Demo Deployment**  
- Runs locally with full functionality  
- Scalable microservice design  

### Scalable by Design

The system can be deployed to:

- Cloud platforms (Render, AWS, GCP, Azure)  
- Mobile apps (Flutter / React Native)  
- IoT devices (field cameras)
